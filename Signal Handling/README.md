# Signal Handling
A very simple program using signal handling to execute threads in specific time intervals, including 1, 2 and 4 seconds. The time taken for each thread to start running, and the 
time taken for the signal to be sent to the thread, is calculated and displayed in the output of the program. 
# Usage
Simply clone the repository or copy all files into the same directory. Run the make command on your desired command line interface (or gcc command), and simply run the executable. You will need to be logged in as root user to set the scheduling parameters of the threads. 
# What I Learned
- Threads run different processes on the same operating system. 
- Programs that require multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously: threads can improve performance.
